## Cat Paper Collection

As reported by Cisco, 90% of net traffic will be visual, and indeed, most of the visual data are cat photos and videos. Thus, understanding, modeling and synthesizing our feline friends becomes a more and more important research problem these days, especially for our cat lovers.
